dune-gdt is a DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org) module which provides a
generic discretization toolbox for grid-based numerical methods. It contains
building blocks - like local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers -
for discretization methods as well as generic interfaces for objects like
discrete function spaces and basefunction sets. Default implementations for
these objects are provided using several of the main DUNE discretization
modules, like dune-fem (http://dune.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/) or
dune-fem-localfunctions
(http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-fem-localfunctions).

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
dune-gdt-demos (http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-gdt-demos).
Experienced DUNE users may go ahead. As usual, you will have to call autogen,
configure and make using dunecontrol
(see http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html), working
examples are located in 'examples/'...
